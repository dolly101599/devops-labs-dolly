# 📚 Inspired Learning Repository
This repository is my hands-on DevOps learning journey, inspired by and built by practicing the work from the original source:

Original Author: Dipto Chakrabarty
Original Repo: https://github.com/DiptoChakrabarty/learn_devops_with_projects

All rights and credits to the original creator for the structured learning reference.

I forked / adapted / practiced these labs to gain real-world hands-on experience and build confidence in core DevOps, SRE & Cloud concepts.

## 🎯 Goal of This Repository

To convert theory into hands-on experience by learning from open-source labs and building:

Real DevOps pipelines

Kubernetes deploy process

Terraform automation

GitOps mindset

Cloud automation discipline

This is not a copy — it’s a guided practice record, similar to a learning notebook 📘💻

## 🙌 Thanks & Credit

I want to thank the original author for sharing the foundational learning repo — it has been extremely helpful in strengthening my DevOps foundations and real-world readiness.
